cl-win32ole is Windows OLE Library like Ruby's win32ole.

cl-win32ole works with SBCL and CLISP(Thanks, Matthew D. Swank),
and possibly any lisp supported by :cffi and :trivial-garbage.

cl-win32ole requires cffi, cl-ppcre, trivial-garbage and simple-date-time.

You can get simple-date-time from darcs repository.
